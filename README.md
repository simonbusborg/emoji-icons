# :sparkles: Emoji Unicode icons :sparkles:
:ghost: Emoji icons from unicode as web icons. Get emoji unicodes here <a href="http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode">apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode</a>

#### How it works
Just like regular icons, emoji-icons uses the psuedo elements and unicode to display an icon. By using the unicode you'll get your system right emojis displayed.

# :sparkles: Emoji Unicode icons :sparkles:
Emoji icons from unicode as web icons. Get emoji unicodes here <a href="http://emojipedia.org/unicode-8.0/">emojipedia.org/unicode-8.0/</a>. :ghost:

#### How it works
Just like regular icons, emoji-icons uses the psuedo elements and unicode to display an icon. By using the unicode you'll get your system right emojis displayed.

**Example**
`<i class="-emoji-icon -bomb"></i>` = :bomb:
